## :book: Code of Conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) :)

## :bulb: Asking Questions

If you are having trouble with something (e.g. trouble building Lunix) please use Discussions. For bugs go to Issues.

## :warning: Opening an Issue

Before you create an issue, please check if you are running the latest version of Lunix. Update using `git pull` and rebuild Lunix, then try to replicate the issue again

## :bug: Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute to Lunix is to provide a well detailed issue. It helps me and others make Lunix better :D

## :mailbox: Feature Requests

Feature requests are definitely welcome, I need ideas and stuff to add to Lunix.

## :construction: Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are very welcome! For most contributions, after your pull request is accepted and gets merged, you will be invited to be a contributor of the repository! :DD

- **Smaller is better.** Submit one pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation. Do not refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change. It is better to submit many small pull requests rather than a single large one. Enormous pull requests will take enormous amounts of time to review, or may be rejected altogether.

- **Add documentation.** Document your changes with code doc comments or in existing guides.

- **Update the CHANGELOG** for all enhancements and bug fixes. Include the corresponding issue number if one exists, and your GitHub username. (example: "- Fixed crash in profile view. #123 @jessesquires")

- **Use the repo's default branch.** Branch from and submit your pull request to the repo's default branch. Usually this is main, but it could be dev, develop, or master.

- **[Resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)** that occur.

- **Promptly address any CI failures.** If your pull request fails to build or pass tests, please push another commit to fix it.

## :memo: Writing Commit Messages

Please [write a great commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (example: "Fix networking issue")
1. Wrap the body at about 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain **why**, *not what and how* (the code shows that!)
1. If applicable, prefix the title with the relevant component name. (examples: "docs: Fix typo", " Fix missing avatar")

## :white_check_mark: Code Review

- **Review the code, not the author.** Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.

- **You are not your code.** When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review personally.

- **Always do your best.** No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.

- Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document.
